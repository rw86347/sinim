# Sinim Bible App

Single file, web-based, Bible application designed for offline use.

- Allow people to read and print the entire Bible using most devices that have a web browser.
- Easily transferable with a thumb drive or microSD card.
- Allows for side loading on a device without any warnings.
- Give people the plan of salvation.
- Educate people on how cell phones are used for tracking.
